# What is organizational culture?

Organizational Culture is a generic term used to describe the shared values within an organization. I suggest you read this article by [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/05/what-is-organizational-culture).

> “Organizational culture defines a jointly shared description of an organization from within.” — Bruce Perron

## The role of "The Organization" in Agile

Agile is a concept composed by many factors, among them there is the Organization. The main role of the organization is to ensure that the team is able to fulfill [[The History of agile#The Pillars]]:

> [!EXAMPLE]  Pillars
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan

Agile emerges from the Team, the Project, and the Stakeholders. Yet, without solid ground, there can be no success on any Agile project. 
The organization is the one providing that solid base. Ensuring all the team member's safety to take risks and try new things without being blamed as guilty for a mistake.

It's important to understand what we are calling "The organization" because it is not only the formal entity and its partners, but every single person that works or helps the organization, it's about the individual commitment towards better results.

## Agile Culture

It's easy to overlook culture in an [[agile team]]. When we focus only on the 3 to 9 people that are part of the core SCRUM team. Yet that is a terrible mistake, since for that team to be productive they need assistance from the organization, and help to stay dedicated and focused on the work to be done.

With that said, there are a few key values that compose an agile culture:
> [!EXAMPLE]  Key values
>
> - Encourage greater responsibility and teamwork. Allowing everyone to know the team's performance and ask for better results, with no hierarchy.
> - At the same time, allow more individual freedom, so each person can organize the way that fits them best.
> - Help the team gain more confidence in their work.
> - Build a solid understanding that the focus is on the Value delivered to the client and each one can choose their best way towards it.
> - Do not worry about time sheets only about deliveries. Everyone on the team must be able to have good time management.

Agile culture is a change of paradigm. It completely changes the way we think and do people interactions (Team, clients, and stakeholders). When agile becomes the DNA of the organization everyone starts to work closer and more engaged in the pursuit of a common Ideal.

## In a nutshell

> [!abstract] Summaries 
> - Being agile is working to deliver value, not to follow detailed, rigid, and standardized planning or bureaucracy. 
> - The main challenge is to build this Agile culture and not only start doing some practices or use some methods or tools.
> - Agile culture helps decisions be made faster and with a better understanding of the problem. 
> - And achieve a well-served client, by happy and motivated people, ensures a healthy long-term relationship.
