# What is Organizational Culture?

Organizational Culture is a generic term to describe an organization's shared values. I suggest you read this article by [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/05/what-is-organizational-culture).

> "Organizational culture defines a jointly shared description of an organization from within." â€” Bruce Perron

## The role of "The Organization" in Agile

Agile is a concept composed of many factors, including the Organization. The central role of the Organization is to ensure that the team can fulfill [[The History of agile#The Pillars]]:

> [!EXAMPLE] Pillars
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan

Agile emerges from the Team, the Project, and the Stakeholders. Yet, without solid ground, there can be no success on any Agile project.
The Organization provides a solid base and ensures all the team members' safety to take risks and try new things without being blamed for a mistake.
It's essential to understand what we call "The organization" because it is not only the formal entity and its partners but every single person who works or helps the Organization; it's about the individual commitment towards better results.
## Agile Culture

It's easy to overlook Culture in an [[agile team]]. Focusing only on the 3 to 9 people who are part of the core Scrum team is a terrible mistake since for that team to be productive, they need assistance from the organization and help to stay dedicated and focused on the work.

With that said, there are a few fundamental values that compose an agile culture:

> [!EXAMPLE] Key values
>
> - Encourage greater responsibility and teamwork. Allowing everyone to know the team's performance and ask for better results, with no hierarchy.
> - At the same time, allow more individual freedom so each person can organize the way that fits them best.
> - Help the team gain more confidence in their work.
> - Build a solid understanding that the focus is on the value delivered to the client and that each can choose their best way.
> - Do not worry about timesheets, only about deliveries. Everyone on the team must have good time management skills.

Agile Culture is a change of paradigm. It completely changes how we think and interact with people (Teams, clients, and stakeholders). When agile becomes the Organization's DNA, everyone starts to work closer and be more engaged in pursuing a common ideal.

## In a nutshell

> [!abstract] Summaries
> - Being agile is working to deliver value, not to follow detailed, rigid, and standardized planning or bureaucracy.
> - The main challenge is to build this Agile Culture and not only start doing some practices or use some methods or tools.
> - Agile Culture helps decisions be made faster and with a better understanding of the problem.
> - Achieving a well-served client by happy and motivated people ensures a healthy long-term relationship.
