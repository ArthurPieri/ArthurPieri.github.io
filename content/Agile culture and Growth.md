# Agile Culture and Growth

One of the main benefits of the Agile culture is that it allows us to keep learning. Keep trying to improve and not be afraid of possible mistakes (knowing that a mistake is a good improvement opportunity.

Agile is about learning, improvement, and growth. It is about you being able to adapt and reach your goals. It goes deeper and further than just attending courses, workshops, or training camps. It's about trying, failing, trying again, and keep moving forward with the eyes on the prize (Value to the customer).

## Goals and Learning

Defining clear Goals and Objectives is vital to the [[Agile culture]].

With Goals and objectives, the team can self-organize. Without them, there is no planning and no way to learn from mistakes; after all, **What would be a mistake**?

You can learn more about goals by reading [[_How to define Goals]].

## Learning from past Success (and failures)

The other essential part of the [[Agile culture]] is to always look back to previous [[projects]], [[sprints]], or attempts and dissect them, find out what you think could be better, and what should remain.

Understanding that even though software engineers crafted the Agile Manifesto, it was never about software. It was always about people and finding the best for the parties involved.

Every organization, therefore, must focus on providing an environment that allows for autonomy, trust, motivation, and meaningful relations.

There are an infinite number of ways to create this culture. One way to do it is by encouraging a management process that focuses on:

- Inspection
- Adaptation
- Communication
- Quick value delivery
