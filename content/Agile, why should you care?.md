In the past decade, we've heard more and more about "Agility," "[[Agile]]," "[[_Scrum]]," and some other ways we could grow past the Waterfall model.

## What is Agile?

[[Agile techniques]] exist between order and chaos. They don't demand complete order and everything working perfectly, just a clear, well-defined, [[Goal]]. Everything else will adjust at the right time.

Knowing that [[agile]] seems to be the ideal way to manage projects that:

- Have multiple ways to reach the final Goal;
- Have no clear path towards the completion;
- Have lots of external interference on results;
- Are complex and can have many valid outcomes.

> To help you understand, let's think of an example where Agile would be ideal (besides the use in [[software development]] since it is its primary use).

## Example: Marketing APie

A marketing agency wants to make a new campaign using "memes" to raise awareness of its Brand. They are trying to think of ways to make that happen and come up with two options.

### Traditional Management

They could use the traditional way to manage the project, so they would:

1. Have a kick-off meeting;
2. Research memes that are trending;
3. Create a Project Plan;
4. Ask if everyone agrees with the plan;
5. Review feedback;
6. Budget the plan;
7. Ask for approval;
8. Plan, step-by-step, all that is needed;
9. Craft and validate the Project charter;
10. Select each member of the team that fits the role needed;
11. Only after all this, start working on the "Dankest of all memes."

As we can see, it took a long time to start working on the project, and by the time they started, all the planning would have gone to waste since the "meme world" changes very fast; what they looked up last week is no longer trending, its "outdated."

### Using Agile

On the other hand, by using an Agile approach, we would:

1. Define a set of metrics
2. Select a handful of options and launch them in a "beta testing" type of approach
3. Keep track of the best performers
4. Improve based on metrics
5. Repeat

By using an Agile approach, the company knows it needs to deploy an "[[MVP]]," a proof of concept as soon as possible, and keep improving on what performs best. And even though they may have yet to launch a final version of the campaign, they would have collected data and reached out to many people differently.

Therefore, in this example, it's clear that the Agile approach is the best, but does it mean it is always the best?
