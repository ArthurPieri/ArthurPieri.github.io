Previously we've talked about [[Agile, why should you care?]]. But how can you care about something you don't understand what is?To solve that problem we are going to create a definition that will be used in my posts from now on.

## Dictionary definition
Defining agile can be tricky. If we look at the Dictionary definition it says: 
> "Characterized by quickness, lightness, and ease of movement; nimble."

And maybe that's why the First Signatories of the [[Agile Manifesto]] decided to use this name. As a counterpoint to the traditional methods, and their need to control, which were extremely time-consuming and kept the team away from the true work: Developing software.

## Project Management definition
On the Project Management side, the definition is still up for debate. But we can use what was published in: International Journal of Project Management, Volume 34, Issue 4, May 2016, Agile is a construct formed by 3 main factors:

> Agile must be seen as a result, it refers to the team's performance and not as an adjective for a specific method
> The Agile team performance is affected by a sum of [[Ability to change]] the [[Project Plan]] and the [[client's active involvement]] throughout the project.
> [[Agile]], as a [[Team performance indicator]], has different levels and must take into account both internal and external factors.

## [The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html)
There is of course a few core principles that were created and defined in [[The History of agile]], and the agile manifesto.

## Defining APie
Using what we learned so far we can agree with a simpler definition, that will be used in all the posts of this blog:

> [!note]  Definition
>
> "Agile is a quality for [[the Project]],  [[the Team]]  and [[the Organization]]. And it must be present in the whole process. So we are working in an Agile Environment when:
> - The team can, frequently, deliver valuable features or products to the client;
> - The team can accept changes in the planning, as long as those changes drive us closer toward the Project goal;
> - The company (organization) provides the tools, inputs, requirements, and support so that the Team can work best and deliver the most "Value". 
> - Understand that definition is key when trying to implement an Agile project. Since it needs full commitment from all the stakeholders and parties involved with the project.
