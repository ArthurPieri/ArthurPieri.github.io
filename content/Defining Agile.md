Previously, we've talked about ˜[[Agile, why should you care?]]˜. But how can you care about something you need to help understand what it is? To solve that problem, we will create a definition that will be used in my posts from now on.

## Dictionary definition
Defining agile can be tricky. If we look at the Dictionary definition, it says: 
> "Characterized by quickness, lightness, and ease of movement; nimble."

That could be why the First Signatories of the [Agile Manifesto]] decided to use this name as a counterpoint to the traditional methods and their need for control, which were highly time-consuming and kept the team from the actual work: Developing software.

## Project Management definition
On the Project Management side, the definition is still up for debate. But we can use what was published in the International Journal of Project Management, Volume 34, Issue 4, May 2016. Agile is a construct formed by three main factors:

> Agile must be seen. As a result, it refers to the team's performance and not as an adjective for a specific method.
> The Agile team performance is affected by the [[Ability to change]] the [[Project Plan]] and the [[client's active involvement]] throughout the project.
> [[Agile]], as a [[Team performance indicator]], has different levels and must consider internal and external factors.

## [The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html)
Of course, a few core principles were created and defined in [[The History of Agile and the Agile Manifesto.

## Defining APie
Using what we have learned so far, we can agree with a more straightforward definition that will be used in all the posts of this blog:

> [!note]  Definition
>
> "Agile is a quality for [[the Project]],  [[the Team]], and [[the Organization]]. And it must be present in the whole process. So we are working in an Agile Environment when:
> - The team can frequently deliver valuable features or products to the client;
> - The team can accept changes in the planning as long as those changes drive us closer to the Project goal;
> - The company (organization) provides the tools, inputs, requirements, and support so that the Team can work best and deliver the most "Value." 
> - Understand that definition is critical when implementing an Agile project since it needs total commitment from all the stakeholders and parties involved.
