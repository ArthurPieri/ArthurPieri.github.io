## [The road to](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html)

In the spring of 2000, a group of Leaders from the Software development and Management community gathered to discuss alternatives to the documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes.

There were representatives from different perspectives like Extreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming, and others sympathetic to the need for change.

After they realized that there was a common ground between those techniques and that it could be explored they scheduled a new meeting. In February 2001 the meeting happened with the Original Signatories (most of whom are still big respectable names in the industry to this day) and they wrote the first draft of the Manifesto.

After some exchanges, they decided to change the name from Lightweight to something more meaningful, something that reflected their shared vision and showed what they were truly looking for: a more responsive, more [[Agile]] way to manage projects.

## The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

### The Pillars

> [!EXAMPLE] Pillars
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## The 12 Principles

We follow these principles:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## The road since

Even though it was initially planned for and by Software developers the core principles and their applications have been proven useful in countless other contexts.
And as time went on, people tried different experiments and applications and got increasingly better results. Therefore Agile has long surpassed Software development and became a useful tool in Project Management as a whole.
